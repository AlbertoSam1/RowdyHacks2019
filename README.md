# RowdyHacks2019
24-hr Hackaton

## Inspiration
UTSA as a whole has to view their final exams online via a PDF. This has been going on for countless years and it's time for someone to do something about it! So behold, a customized final exam scheduler for each student!

## What it does
You can make a list of your final exam schedule by finding your classes and narrowing down by day and even time!

## How we built it
Blood, sweat, tears, Java and Android Studio were used to compose this app.

## Challenges we ran into
Each person on our team only knew one language, so cross scripting ensued!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a fully functional application that future roadrunners would be able to take advantage of!

## What we learned
Through trial and error, we have learned more about ourselves and what we are far more capable than we imagine!

## What's next for RowdyBreeze!
Implementing into UTSA's main mobile applications
